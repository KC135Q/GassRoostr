## 3.2 Lesson Plan - Jumping for Javascript 

### Overview
Today's class is focused on introducing students to the concept of For-Loops and how for-loops can be used in combination with arrays, if-then statements, and other common programming tools to create a Rock Paper Scissors game.

##### Instructor Priorities:

* Students should understand what a for-loop is and how to utilize one to loop through an array.
* Students should complete the Zoo Loop Activity `5-ZooLoop`.
* Students should complete the Rock-Paper-Scissors Activity `9-RPS-Coded`.

##### Instructor Notes:

* In today's class you will be covering the concept of For-Loops and subsequently the concept of combining arrays, conditionals, for-loops, and user inputs to create more sophisticated Javascript applications. Much of what students have learned to date will culminate in the last activity of the day where they will work together to build a Rock Paper Scissors Game.

* Today's lesson plan is packed to the brink with activities. Realistically assess your usual pace. If you are an instructor who tends to fall behind, skip activities which say ("TIME PERMITTING") on the slides. If you tend to speak and present at a fast pace, take the time to complete as many of these exercises as you like. Alternatively, you can always just show students the solution to these activities in a live demo and then slack them the answers. Just BE SURE to leave around 1 hour of classtime for students to work on the Rock Paper Scissors Activity. This activity is extremely important and a close match to their homework assignment.

* For the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game, students should be given a large chunk of time to complete the activity. They will not have been given everything they need to complete the activity. Bits of code like the code needed to capture user-input, for instance, will not have been covered. The idea here is for students to become more comfortable with the idea of working without knowing "everything". Throughout the moments where they are working in class, "reveal" bits of the solution using the code found in the `9-RPS-Coded` folder. The files inside of this folder break down the solution into bits and pieces. Throughout class, show these bits of the solution on the projector and try to help guide students in the direction they are ultimately going towards. 

* Have your TAs reference [3.2-TimeTracker](3.2-TimeTracker.xlsx) to help keep track of time during class. Seriously TA's bring your time-tracking A-Game. This is an easy class to lose track of time during. Your Instructor NEEDS to leave enough time for students to complete the Rock Paper Scissors Game.

* Note: Even if you don't cover an activity in class, still include it in the list of activities you share into your local repo. Students will be able to look back at these activities on their own time.

	* Starting from scratch, create a for loop that prints the following lines: 
	I am 0 
	I am 1 
	I am 2
	I am 3
	I am 4

	* Don’t use an array in this case.

	* Make certain to start completely from scratch this time.

### 14.	Instructor Do: Review 6-AnotherLoop	(0:05)

![/Images/6-AnotherLoop.png](Images/6-AnotherLoop.png)

* Then slack out the solution.

### 15.	Partners Do: Loop with Conditions	(0:00)

* Again, if you are WELL AHEAD of schedule, offer the following activity. But remember! You need to leave at least ONE HOUR for the following Rock Paper Scissors Activity. If necessary, go straight to the solution or skip this entirely. 

* **Instructions:**

	* Starting from scratch, create code that loops through the following array: 

	```
	var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];

	```

	* And prints out the names of the animals on the farm.

	* Then, using the .charAt() method (research it), check if the first letter in the animal’s name begins with a “c” or “o”. If it does, then create an alert saying: “Starts with c or an o!”

### 16.	Instructor Do: Review 7-HardLoop	(0:00)

* Review the solution from the previous activity `HardLoop.html` (`7-HardLoop).

* Have students play the game rock-paper scissors with one another for a few moments.

* Some students may not understand why they are doing this, but really make them play it! 

### 18.	Students Do: Pseudocode RPS	(0:08)

* Once they've done this for a few rounds, have them create a pseudocoded solution that lays out the "steps" involved in play Rock-Paper-Scissors against a computer. 

* Slack out the following instructions:

* **Instructions:**

	* With a partner, spend a few moments outlining all the steps and conditions that go into rock paper scissors. 

	* Try to break it down into steps that you could “code out”

	* Think of basic elements like loops, if-then statements, arrays, alerts, etc.

	* Be prepared to share your outlined approach.

* **INSTRUCTORS ONLY:** When time is up, show your own RPS-Pseudocode found here: `PseudoCodeRPS.html` (`8-PseudoCode`)

### 19.	Instructor Demo: Show RPS Final (Browser)	(0:02)

* Then open up the file `rps-9.html` (`9-RPS-Coded`) in the browser. Show students that this is what they will be building for the next hour.

* Let them know that it will be a hard activity and that it will require them to learn things on the fly.

* Then open the file `rps-2.html` and take a few moments to discuss it with them. Point out how we are storing the default options in an array and checking if a "click" matched that value.

-----------

### 20.	BREAK	(0:40)

* Touch base with TAs regarding pace at this point in time and decide what assignments you can and cannot feasibly include so as to provide students with at least one hour to work on the Rock Paper Scissors assignment later on.

-----------


### 21.	Partners Do: Coding out RPS	(1:10)

* Slack out the following files and instructions to students:

* **File:**

	* `rps-2.html` (`9-RPS-Coded`)

* **Instructions:**

	* In groups of 4, begin the process of coding out the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game. 

	* Do as much as you can on your own but raise your hand regularly to ask a TA or Instructor to help if you feel your team is struggling.

	* Note: Don’t worry. We know this is a very challenging assignment. We also know that you won’t know where to start. In fact, we haven’t shown you EVERYTHING you need yet. But that’s okay. Accepting the confusion is a HUGE first step in becoming a coder since coding is all one big puzzle you solve with time and effort.

### 22.	Instructor Do: Review RPS	(0:10)

* Open the file `rps-9.html` (`9-RPS-Coded`) and walk students through the solution. Use the comments in the solution to help guide the conversation.

![/Images/9-RPS_4.png](Images/9-RPS_4.png)

------



### 23.	Partners Do: Array Building	(0:10)

* Proceed with the first activity on array building. 

* In this activity, students just fill in the empty comments for each line of code. This is intended to passively show them how to use for-loops to populate arrays.

* Slack out the following files and instructions: 

* **File:**

	* `LoopTV_Unsolved.html` (`1-LoopTV`)

* **Instructions:**

	* Run the program sent to you via slack. 

	* Then, with a partner, fill in the missing comments for each line of code. 

	* Make sure both of you can fully explain what each line means. 

	* Be prepared to share with the class!

### 24.	Instructor Do: Review Activity	(0:10)

* Go over the solution. First have them try to explain each line of code to you as a class.

* Then you can open `LoopTV_Solved.html` and walk them through the solution. 

* Slack out the file when done. 

![/Images/1-LoopTV.png](Images/1-LoopTV.png)

### 25.	Instructor Do: Logging No Functions	(0:05)

* Open the file `SuperHeroLogging_Solved_NoFunctions.html` (`2-SuperHeroLogging`) in Chrome and Sublime. 

* Walk students through the basics of how this application works. In essence, the application has a series of repeated for loops which print out the contents of each of the 6 arrays.

* The key point to emphasize to students is that this code is *extremely* repetitive and kind of bulky because of it. This code is intended to offer them perspective on why functions are useful.

* Slack out the file when done with your explanation. 

### 26.	Instructor Do: SuperHeroLogging_WithFunctions	(0:05)

* Open the file `SuperHeroLogging_Solved_WithFunctions.html` (`2-SuperHeroLogging`) in Chrome and Sublime.

* Walk students through this solution as well. Point out how this application greatly simplifies the previous activity by reducing the number of for-loops to just one. 

![/Images/2-SuperHeroLogging.png](Images/2-SuperHeroLogging.png)

* Be sure to point out how the function is composed of two pats. 

	* The function **definition**

	* The function **call** (or execution)

* Ask if there are any questions, then proceed to slack out the file so students can use it as an example for the next activity.
